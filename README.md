## About

I'm a full-stack engineer based in India who builds and ships production-grade systems. Over the past few years, I've worked across freelance client engagements, SaaS product initiatives (most under NDA), and a growing portfolio of self-built applications — each one deployed, used, and iterated on in production.

I didn't come from a traditional pipeline. I learned by building — real projects for real clients with real deadlines. That path taught me to prioritize execution over perfection, ship before polishing, and treat every deployment as a feedback loop. I've built WordPress platforms that drive business revenue, SaaS tools that handle user sessions and file transfers at scale, and utility apps that I personally rely on daily.

My approach to engineering is rooted in system-level thinking. I don't just build features — I think about state management, auth flows, edge cases in session handling, SEO performance, and how the architecture will hold up six months from now. I've debugged orphan nodes in Firebase at 2 AM, refactored entire UI layers to eliminate layout thrashing, and shipped production hotfixes on tight turnarounds.

I operate with an AI-accelerated workflow — not an AI-dependent one. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude CLI, and Kilo Code are part of my daily stack, but every line of code ships with manual review, architectural intent, and performance awareness.

I'm comfortable operating under ambiguity, making tradeoffs in real time, and working independently without waiting for a spec to be handed down. When I take on work, I own it end to end — from architecture to deployment to post-ship iteration.

Freelance exposure has given me client communication skills, scope negotiation instincts, and the discipline to deliver under constraints. SaaS experience has taught me to think in terms of user sessions, data integrity, auth boundaries, and system reliability. Interview exposure across multiple rounds has sharpened my ability to articulate decisions under pressure.

I don't build pages. I build systems.

## Selected Client Builds

Production-deployed WordPress platforms built for business clients. Optimized for performance, SEO, and conversion.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <a href="https://deggy.com" target="_blank">Deggy</a> | Client-facing business platform — custom build, performance-optimized, production deployed |
| <a href="https://www.paverskinginc.com" target="_blank">Pavers King Inc</a> | Commercial services platform — SEO-optimized, responsive, conversion-focused |

These weren't template drops. Each involved understanding the client's business model, structuring content for search visibility, optimizing load performance, and deploying a system the client could rely on without handholding.

## Live Applications

Over 60% of my repositories are deployed to production. My portfolio isn't a static showcase — it's an evolving system built through rapid iteration cycles, weekend execution grinds, and a blend of architecture with AI-assisted acceleration.

| Project | Stack | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| <a href="https://www.send2me.site" target="_blank">Send2Me</a> | Next.js, Firebase | Secure peer-to-peer file transfer system with session-based auth, real-time sync, and ghost token cleanup |
| <a href="https://gpmas-gaurav.vercel.app" target="_blank">GPMAS</a> | React, Node.js | Full-stack productivity application — auth, data persistence, production deployed |
| <a href="https://streamwherefinder.vercel.app" target="_blank">StreamWhereFinder</a> | Next.js, API Integration | Streaming availability search engine with multi-provider aggregation and responsive UI |
| <a href="https://gauravs-personal-drive.vercel.app" target="_blank">Personal Drive</a> | React, Firebase | Personal cloud storage interface with file management, access control, and persistent state |
| <a href="https://gmp-one.vercel.app" target="_blank">GMP One</a> | React, Vercel | Utility-first application — clean architecture, fast iteration, functional UI |
| <a href="https://gaurav-personal-notes.vercel.app/login" target="_blank">Personal Notes</a> | Next.js, Firebase | Authenticated notes platform with persistent storage and session management |

Every project listed here is live, functional, and maintained. These aren't tutorials repackaged — they're tools I built because I needed them or because a problem was worth solving.

## Open Source

Several projects are open source — spanning production-grade prototypes and focused experiments. My architecture favors transparency and modularity. Public repositories are actively maintained, and contributions are welcome.

I believe in building in the open when possible. Open-source work keeps the code honest, the architecture clean, and the thinking sharp.

## AI-Assisted Engineering Workflow

AI tooling is integrated as an execution accelerator — used for rapid prototyping, architectural validation, and iteration speed. Never as a crutch. Every output is reviewed, tested, and shipped with full manual oversight.

**Tooling in active rotation:**

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| GitHub Copilot | In-editor code completion and pattern acceleration |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Terminal-level command generation and workflow automation |
| Claude CLI | Architectural reasoning, code review, and complex problem decomposition |
| Kilo Code | AI-assisted coding with contextual awareness |
| Codebuff | Rapid prototyping and code generation |
| Replit Core | Fast environment spin-up and experimentation |
| Lovable | UI/UX prototyping and design-to-code workflows |

These tools amplify output. They don't replace judgment.

## Engineering Philosophy

```
→ Execution > Overengineering
→ Build systems, not pages
→ Performance-aware by default
→ Comfortable operating under ambiguity
→ Ship first. Refine always.
→ Production-first thinking
→ Own it end to end
→ Every deployment is a feedback loop
```
